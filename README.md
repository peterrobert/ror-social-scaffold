# Social media app with Ruby on Rails

> This is the last project in the Ruby on Rails section of the Microverse Full-Stack development program. We've had to apply everything we've learned throughout the section to get it done. We've implemented our own models, controllers, views and relationships with other models. Also, we've implemented user authentication for our controllers, and we've had to refactor how friendships work at the database level, and change models accordingly.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.0
- Ruby on Rails v5.2.4
